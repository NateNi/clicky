## Lord of the Rings Clicky Game

### What the project does
This project allows the user to play a memory game in which they must click on as many characters as possible while they shuffle position randomly, without clicking on any more than once.  If a character is clicked on a second time, a game over message appears and the user can try again.

### Why the project is useful
The clicky game is intended as a fun, yet challenging game for users.  It exercises memory skills in an enjoyable way.

### How users can get started with the project
The method of playing the game is simple.  Click on characters that you haven't clicked on before to increase your score.  If your score is high enough, it will become your top score.
